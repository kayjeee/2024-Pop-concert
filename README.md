# 2024-Pop-concert
A website for an upcoming concert will be held within cape town University Technology Club. General information about the club and the party is given throughout the site. artist are introduced in a separate section. In addition, a form page is defined for participants who want to buy tickets."

The website content is fictional. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to meet the requirements defined within the scope of the Microverse Capstone project. In particular, I would like to point out that I built this website completely from scratch.
